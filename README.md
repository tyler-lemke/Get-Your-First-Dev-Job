# Get Your First Dev Job in 6-12 Months (Even if you have Struggled)

## Who is this for?

- You have, or will have 500-1000 hrs of deliberate practice programming by the time you interview
- You have struggled to get a dev job and need some direction
- You are going to graduate from College or Bootcamp
- You are trying to land an internship
- Not looking to get into a highly competitive company

## How long will this take?

- Probably 3-12 months depending on your commitment, luck, and desire.

Sometimes you just need a little direction and some resources to head you in the right direction.

## Common Traps that you have or may fall into on your Journey:

- Jump from one tutorial to the next without completing any of them or without having anything unique to shoe
- Always looking for the next perfect piece of information which is the silver bullet to landing a job
- Imposters Syndrome (thinking you are worse than you are)
- The Dunning-Kruger Effect (thinking you are much better than you are)
- Not sticking to a systemized process that will nearly guarantee results

Here is a daily schedule you can use as a sort of blueprint for the next 3-6 months as you plan to land a job

## Skills Needed to Land The Job

Landing a Role will consist of at least these factors and probably more

- Soft Skills
- Networking (Who you know)
- Marketing Yourself / Personal Branding (Knowing yourself and how to highlight your strengths)
- Time Management
- Algorithm Problem Solving
- Practical Software Development

The daily schedule will touch on the most important parts of this, but it is modifiable according to your needs.
